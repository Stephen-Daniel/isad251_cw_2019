            You tube video address.      https://youtu.be/s7yOxj_0HmY  
The video may be 5 minutes long but I wanted to show both full screen and mobile phone screen abilities.



The CAFE 2020 has an in house app that allows you the customer to order from your table.

A navigation bar that is found on the top of every page is an easy point and click to take you
to that page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the customers


We have daily reading articles from local writers. these would be changed daily and allows 
you to read while you are waiting for you order.

With a future option to register for discounts you would then have login details as a valid customer. 

If you dont want to sign up you can still jump straight in to order.

A large clear pictured menu awaits showing you the prices. All picked items are sort in you cart ready to order.

In the cart you can still add to what you have, delete any items or just go back.

In checkout an email would be sent to you to comfirm the order and the time received.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the owner

The app also helps the owner with an indepth admin selection

For this demo username == admin and password == password (that should never be used)

The admin will allow you full access to your database. With an easy to use GUI it is possible
to add, edit, delete any item, in any table of the database.

This section would not be shown to the public as only a correct username and password would take you
to the admin pages. The admin option in the navigation bar would be removed.
